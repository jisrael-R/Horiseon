# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this project I had the opportunity to add  semantic meaning to each section in the index.html
by replacing the <div> tags for the ones that made more  semantic sense. Such as:
<header>
<section>
<article>
<aside>
<footer>
besides adding semantic meaning, I also added the nessesary comments to 
outline each section of the code thus giving it a better readability for future coder
to see.

As far the style.css goes, I simplified sections were the code was redondant, and removed 
some classes in the sections of the html file with one class value. for instance:

In the main section of the code with have 
<!-- Search engine optimization section -->
<!-- online reputation management section -->
<!-- social media marketing section -->
these sections now have a class of "nav-article" since each section will have the same
design, I have grouped them under "nav-article" to target each section thus removing
the repeated code in the file.
